# Draw-Color-Filled-Shapes-in-Turtle-Python
Prerequisite: Python Turtle Basics

turtle is an inbuilt module in python. It provides drawing using a screen (cardboard) and turtle (pen). To draw something on the screen, we need to move the turtle. To move turtle, there are some functions i.e forward(), backward(), etc.

To fill the colors in the shapes drawn by turtle, turtle provides three functions –

fillcolor(): This helps to choose the color for filling the shape. It takes the input parameter as the color name or hex value of the color and fills the upcoming closed geographical objects with the chosen color. Color names are basic color names i.e. red, blue, green, orange.
The hex value of color is a string(starting with ‘#’) of hexadecimal numbers i.e. #RRGGBB. R, G, and B are the hexadecimal numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F).

begin_fill(): This function tells turtle that all upcoming closed graphical objects needed to be filled by the chosen color.

end_fill(): this function tells turtle to stop the filling upcoming closed graphical objects.
